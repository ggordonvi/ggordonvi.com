                                Originally from California, I've called the East Coast home for the past 8 years currently residing in Charlotte, NC. I graduated from the University of South Carolina with a solid foundation in computer science, and since then, I've immersed myself in the ever-evolving world of software development. In my current role, I wear many hats - from leader and mentor to solution architect and senior developer. I thrive on the challenge of finding innovative solutions to complex problems, collaborating closely with cross-functional teams to deliver impactful results.

                                Outside of the office, you'll often find me exploring the great outdoors, whether it's hiking scenic trails, hitting the gym, or cheering on my favorite sports teams. I'm also a curious traveler, always eager to discover new cities. My diverse interests and active lifestyle fuel my creativity and keep me motivated both personally and professionally.
